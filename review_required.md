### Review Required Pages

Reviewing a page is as easy as these 3 steps:

 - Review the page and change it according to Naemon
 - Remove the <i>{% raw %}{% include review_required.md %}{% endraw %}</i> at the top of the page
 - Send a pull request to update the page

<div class="alert alert-info" style="margin: 10px;"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></i> <a href="/documentation/faq/#documentation">Details on how to edit a page can be found in the FAQ.</a></div>
