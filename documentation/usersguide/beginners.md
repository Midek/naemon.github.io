Congratulations on choosing Naemon!  Naemon is quite powerful and flexible, but it can take a lot of work to get it configured just the way you'd like.  Once you become familiar with how it works and what it can do for you, you'll never want to be without it. :-)  Here are some important things to keep in mind for first-time Naemon users:

* **Relax - it's going to take some time.**  Don't expect to be able to get things working exactly the way you want them right off the bat.  it's not that easy.  Setting up Naemon can involve a bit of work - partly because of the options that Naemon offers, partly because you need to know what to monitor on your network (and how best to do it).

* **Use the quickstart instructions.**  The <a href="quickstart.html">quickstart installation guide</a> is designed to get most new users up and running with a basic Naemon setup fairly quickly.  Within 20 minutes you can have Naemon installed and monitoring your local system.  Once that's complete, you can move on to learning how to configure Naemon to do more.

* **Read the documentation.**  Naemon can be tricky to configure when you've got a good grasp of what's going on, and nearly impossible if you don't.  Make sure you read the documentation (particularly the sections on "Configuring Naemon" and "The Basics").  Save the advanced topics for when you've got a good understanding of the basics.

* **Seek the help of others.**  If you've read the documentation, reviewed the sample config files, and are still having problems, send an email message describing your problems to the *nagios-users* mailing list.  Due to the amount of work that I have to do for this project, I am unable to answer most of the questions that get sent directly to me, so your best source of help is going to be the mailing list.  If you've done some background reading and you provide a good problem description, odds are that someone will give you some pointers on getting things working properly.  More information on subscribing to the mailing lists or searching the list archives can be found at <a href="http://www.nagios.org/support/">http://www.nagios.org/support/</a>.
