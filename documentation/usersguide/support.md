### Support

Naemons philosophy is "from the community, for the community", so there are many
ways to get in touch with other users.

We have several of the usual means of contact:

 * Mailing lists: [users list](https://www.monitoring-lists.org/list/listinfo/naemon-users/) | [developers list](https://www.monitoring-lists.org/list/listinfo/naemon-dev/)
 * IRC channels: #naemon and #naemon-devel on freenode
 * Support Forum: [monitoring-portal.org](http://monitoring-portal.org/wbb/index.php?page=Board&boardID=111) (english/german)
