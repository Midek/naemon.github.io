### About Naemon

Visit <a href="http://www.nagios.org/about/" target="_blank">www.nagios.org/about/</a> for more information on Naemon - including features, capabilities, and technical specifications.

### Installation Introduction

These quickstart guides are intended to provide you with simple instructions on how to install Naemon from source (code) and have it monitoring your local machine inside of 20 minutes.  No advanced installation options are discussed here - just the basics that will work for 95% of users who want to get started.

### Installation Guides

Quickstart installation guides are currently available for the following Linux distributions:

<ul>
<li><a href="quickstart-fedora.html">Fedora Quickstart</a></li>
<li><a href="quickstart-opensuse.html">openSUSE Quickstart</a></li>
<li><a href="quickstart-ubuntu.html">Ubuntu Quickstart</a></li>
</ul>

You can also find additional quickstart guides on the <a href="http://wiki.nagios.org/">Naemon Community Wiki</a>.  Can't find a quickstart for your particular OS?  Write one and post it to the wiki for others!

If you are installing Naemon on an operating system or Linux distribution that isn't listed above, read the <a href="quickstart-fedora.html">Fedora quickstart</a> for an overview of what you'll need to do.  Command names, paths, etc. vary widely across different OSes/distributions, so you'll likely need to tweak the installation docs a bit to work for your particular case.
