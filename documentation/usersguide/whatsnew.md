##### Features
 * The config option include_dir allows you to specify a dropdir

 * Check output should no longer be lost unless the kernel drops it
   due to out-of-memory errors
 * We will now always shut down fairly gracefully on OOM errors
 * Workers should no longer cause zombies to appear
 * Several fixes have been made to make building on OSX work
   better
