{"name":"Naemon.github.io","tagline":"The naemon website","body":"## Welcome to Naemon\r\n\r\nThis is the (very) brief homepage for Naemon, the latest fork of Nagios Core.\r\n\r\nNaemon forks off on the latest release of Nagios 4.0.1, with some additional patches on top. Notably, NASA can use Naemon to monitor their supercomputer cluster without any special configuration tweaking, and rotated logs are no longer truncated. In the future, I expect compatibility will diverge, but we will make sure that external API's such as livestatus, the query handler, the object cache file and status data file remain more or less the same. Object configuration won't change hugely in the near future either. Instead we'll focus on extending existing integration points and improving performance and stability in the core.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why fork?\r\n\r\nI (Andreas Ericsson) got kicked out from being a Nagios core developer after having written an overwhelming majority (94.5%) of the changes that took Nagios from version 3 to version 4. Since I feel that was mostly a political move in order to prevent the project from being associated with me rather than Nagios Enterprises rather than based on technical or personal reasons, I decided to launch my own project. Fortunately for me, a lot of people expressed interest in the project right from the start, and a few of them even want to help out and make it really great.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who's doing what?\r\n\r\n* Andreas Ericsson (@ageric) - Core developer\r\n* Dan Wittenberg (@dwittenberg2008) - RPM packaging and testing\r\n* Robin Sonefors (@ozamosi) - Core developer\r\n* Sven Nierlein (@sni) - Core/GUI developer\r\n* You - Whatever you like and can :)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How can I help?\r\n\r\nSend an email to ageric79@gmail.com. Everyone's welcome, assuming you're competent, interested and friendly. We're currently in desperate need of a logo designer and web designer/maintainer but, as with all sane opensource projects, \"patches welcome\" ;-)\r\n\r\n### Community\r\n\r\nFeel free to get in touch with other users and the Naemon developers :\r\n * Users list: https://www.monitoring-lists.org/list/listinfo/naemon-users/\r\n * Developers list: https://www.monitoring-lists.org/list/listinfo/naemon-dev/\r\n * IRC Channel: #naemon and #naemon-devel on freenode - irc://freenode.net/naemon\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
