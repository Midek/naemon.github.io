{"name":"Naemon","tagline":"","body":"## Welcome to Naemon\r\n\r\nThis is the homepage for the Naemon project. The Naemon project includes a monitoring core, as well as an ecosystem of add-on software.\r\n\r\nThe Naemon core is our version of the Nagios 4 core, which has a lot of extra bugfixes - notably, NASA can use Naemon to monitor their supercomputer cluster without any special configuration tweaking. For the time being, it should function as a drop-in replacement for Nagios, but with additional work spent on improving performance and stability. In the future, compatibility will most likely diverge, but we will make sure that external API's behave the more or less the same, such as object configuration, livestatus, the query handler, the object cache file and status data file.\r\n\r\nThe Naemon project also includes a GUI, but not the old Nagios CGI interface - instead we have a fast, modern and more useful replacement, [Thruk](http://thruk.org).\r\n\r\n#### Why fork?\r\n\r\nAndreas Ericsson, who wrote an overwhelming majority (94.5%) of the changes that took Nagios from version 3 to version 4, got kicked out from the Nagios project once version 4 was released. The explanation was fuzzy, and suggested that the underlying reason had more to do with politics and branding, than with any technical shortcomings. In order to continue the development, he decided to launch his own project. He was quickly joined by a growing group of other interested people under the Naemon banner who wanted to help out and make it really great.\r\n\r\n### Community\r\n\r\nNaemon is created by the community, for the community. While the legal stuff isn't done quite yet, we are working toward setting up an independent, non-commercial legal entity to manage the Naemon project, in order to ensure that there will never be a Naemon XI, that the project will always be free, and that decisions will always be based on what is best for the community at large. We do encourage commercial vendors to base their own enterprise offerings on the Naemon code - it's free software, after all - but the project is to exist as its own, distinct entity.\r\n\r\n#### How can I help?\r\n\r\nSend an email to naemon-dev@monitoring-lists.org to get in touch with us. Everyone's welcome, assuming you're competent, interested and friendly. We're currently in desperate need of a logo designer and web designer/maintainer but, as with all sane open source projects, \"patches welcome\" ;-)\r\n\r\nYou can get in touch with other users and developers in several ways:\r\n * Users list: https://www.monitoring-lists.org/list/listinfo/naemon-users/\r\n * Developers list: https://www.monitoring-lists.org/list/listinfo/naemon-dev/\r\n * IRC Channel: #naemon and #naemon-devel on freenode - irc://freenode.net/naemon\r\n\r\n#### Who's doing what?\r\n\r\n* Andreas Ericsson (@ageric) - Core developer\r\n* Dan Wittenberg (@dwittenberg2008) - RPM packaging and testing\r\n* Robin Sonefors (@ozamosi) - Core developer\r\n* Sven Nierlein (@sni) - Core/GUI developer\r\n* You - Whatever you like and can :)\r\n\r\n### Online Demo\r\n\r\nYou can test the online demo of Thruk (the web gui of Naemon) at http://demo.thruk.org","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
