    <h1>Naemon</h1>
    <p>Naemon is the new monitoring suite that aims to be fast, stable
and innovative while giving you a clear view of the state of your
network and applications.</p>
	<p>Next release, which will be 0.9, is scheduled for release <strong>Jan 8
2015</strong>. It has been slightly delayed due to buildsystem problems
(caused by yours truly) but should be no more than a day or two late.<br />
Naemon 1.0, which may break compatibility with older versions of
some modules (but don't worry; Livestatus, Merlin and mod_gearman will
still work as intended) is scheduled for release <strong>Feb 13
2015</strong>.

      <h2>The Core</h2>
      <p>The Naemon core is a network monitoring tool based on the Nagios 4 core, but with many bug fixes, new features, and performance enhancements. If you today use Nagios, you should switch to Naemon to get bugfixes, new features, and performance enhancements.</p>

      <h2>The Suite</h2>
      <p>Rather than the Nagios way of putting everything from UI to check scheduler in one package, we like to keep things more modular. The sum of all the modules that we build and ship will give you a good monitoring suite.</p>

      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p>Naemon is created by the community, for the community, and (soon) owned by the community ourselves. This lets us be governed by our needs, rather than corporate profit motives.</p>
