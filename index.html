<p>This is the (very) brief homepage for Naemon, a recent fork of Nagios Core.</p>

<p>Naemon is originaly based on Nagios 4, with some additional patches on top. On the back end, a lot of bugs have been discovered and fixed - notably, NASA can use Naemon to monitor their supercomputer cluster without any special configuration tweaking. On the front end, Naemon gets rid of the old CGI interface in favor of the faster and more useful <a href="http://thruk.org">Thruk</a> interface. In the future, compatibility will most likely diverge, but we will make sure that external API's such as livestatus, the query handler, the object cache file and status data file remain more or less the same. Object configuration won't change hugely in the near future either. Instead we'll focus on extending existing integration points and improving performance and stability in the core.</p>

<a name="why-fork" class="anchor" href="#why-fork"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why fork?</h3>

<p>Andreas Ericsson, who wrote an overwhelming majority (94.5%) of the changes that took Nagios from version 3 to version 4, got kicked out from the Nagios project once version 4 was released. The explanation was fuzzy, and suggested that the underlying reason had more to do with politics and branding, than with any technical shortcomings. In order to continue the development, he decided to launch his own project. He was quickly joined by a growing group of other interested people under the Naemon banner who wanted to help out and make it really great.</p>
