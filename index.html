<a name="welcome-to-naemon" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-naemon"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Naemon</h2>

<p>This is the homepage for the Naemon project. The Naemon project includes a monitoring core, as well as an ecosystem of add-on software.</p>

<p>The Naemon core is our version of the Nagios 4 core, which has a lot of extra bugfixes - notably, NASA can use Naemon to monitor their supercomputer cluster without any special configuration tweaking. For the time being, it should function as a drop-in replacement for Nagios, with us spending additional work on improving performance and stability. In the future, compatibility will most likely diverge, but we will make sure that external API's, such as object configuration, the query handler, the object cache file and status data file, behave the more or less the same.</p>

<p>The Naemon project also includes a GUI, but not the old Nagios CGI interface - instead we have a fast, modern and more useful replacement, <a href="http://thruk.org">Thruk</a>. We also bundle livestatus, which is how Thruk commuicates with the core.</p>

<a name="why-fork" class="anchor" href="#why-fork"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why fork?</h4>

<p>Andreas Ericsson, who wrote an overwhelming majority (94.5%) of the changes that took Nagios from version 3 to version 4, got kicked out from the Nagios project once version 4 was released. The explanation was fuzzy, and suggested that the underlying reason had more to do with politics and branding, than with any technical shortcomings. In order to continue the development, he decided to launch his own project. He was quickly joined by a growing group of other interested people under the Naemon banner who wanted to help out and make it really great.</p>

<h3>
<a name="community" class="anchor" href="#community"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Community</h3>

<p>Naemon is created by the community, for the community. While the legal stuff isn't done quite yet, we are working toward setting up an independent, non-commercial legal entity to manage the Naemon project, in order to ensure that there will never be a Naemon XI, that the project will always be free, and that decisions will always be based on what is best for the community at large. We do encourage commercial vendors to base their own enterprise offerings on the Naemon code - it's free software, after all - but the project is to exist as its own, distinct entity.</p>
