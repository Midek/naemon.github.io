<p>This is the (very) brief homepage for Naemon, the latest fork of Nagios Core.</p>

<p>Naemon forks off on the latest release of Nagios 4.0.1, with some additional patches on top. Notably, NASA can use Naemon to monitor their supercomputer cluster without any special configuration tweaking, and rotated logs are no longer truncated. In the future, I expect compatibility will diverge, but we will make sure that external API's such as livestatus, the query handler, the object cache file and status data file remain more or less the same. Object configuration won't change hugely in the near future either. Instead we'll focus on extending existing integration points and improving performance and stability in the core.</p>

<a name="why-fork" class="anchor" href="#why-fork"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why fork?</h3>

<p>I (Andreas Ericsson) got kicked out from being a Nagios core developer after having written an overwhelming majority (94.5%) of the changes that took Nagios from version 3 to version 4. Since I feel that was mostly a political move in order to prevent the project from being associated with me rather than Nagios Enterprises rather than based on technical or personal reasons, I decided to launch my own project. Fortunately for me, a lot of people expressed interest in the project right from the start, and a few of them even want to help out and make it really great.</p>
